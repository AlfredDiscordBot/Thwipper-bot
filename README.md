_<h2>What is Thwipper?</h2>_
Everything you need to keep the members of the server entertained, this bot has it. 
Thwipper is inspired from my favorite fictional character Spider-Man. Its name is the onomatopoeia of Spider-Man using his web-shooters. Thwip!<br>
Prefixes => `[t!], [ _ ], [thwip] [thwipper]`<br>

_<h2>Features:-</h2>_

_Wikipedia_<br>

_<h2>Note:-</h2>_
Have the bot token, SQL password, reddit client id, client secret and the user agent in a .py file in the same directory as main.py<br>
Make sure you have all the dependencies installed that are required for this bot to work.<br>
Especially `ffmpeg` as it is required to play music.

To install other dependencies required, use `pip install [dependency]`.<br>
